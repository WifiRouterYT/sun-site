                <h2>Services</h2>
                <p>This is a list of all the services running on my little retro server corner. Some of these are publicly accessible, while others are too insecure to expose to the modern internet. This page is split into sections by the hardware that is running it. You can learn more about all of the cool hardware powering this stuff on the Hardware page! I will also gladly accept donations for more Sun hardware to tinker with.</p>

                <h3>SUN Ultra 10</h3>
                <p>Runs on Solaris 7, or SunOS 5.7 if you may. It has a brand new NVRAM chip, and ran with 1GB of RAM for the longest time until one of the sticks died, and now it'll only use 512MB. It's also the Creator 3D variant, but none of my monitors like the GPU (which was upgraded to a Sun Elite3D). It has also been upgraded with a DVD drive and a larger drive. For the CPU, it's rocking an UltraSPARC IIi at 650MHz. Killer machine, super reliable. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_5/10">Wikipedia</a></p>

                    <li>Archie (link TBD)</li>
                    <li>(Future) Usenet - INN server</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SUN SunFire V20Z</h3>
                <p><i>Currently out of commission, replacement parts on the way!</i></p>
                <p>A pain in the ass of a server to work on, but a mighty machine when it works. Runs on the latest version of OpenIndiana Hipster, and features 8 GB of RAM and dual AMD CPUs (dont know exact model as of writing this). Storage wise, it has two 73GB SCSI drives in RAID 1. It is also very very very loud, not sure if that's because of 1 broken fan or by design. More about this big guy on... eugh just seeing the name makes me wanna vomit... <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19121-01/sf.v40z/817-5248-21/chapter1.html">Oracle's site</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SunRay Server Software for some SunRay 3s I have lying around</li>
                    <li>Hopefully some more stuff soon! (it broke before I could do much with it)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Dell PowerEdge T610</h3>
                <p>A little more modern for a Proxmox instance. Features a single Xeon E5530 (4 core, 2.4GHz) and 96GB of DDR3 RAM. It's outfitted with a ton of drives and RAID configurations totalling to ~18 TB of usable storage. Pretty boring machine frankly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP Server (only because it has a lot of storage)</li>
                    <li>SMB server to store and boot PS2 games</li>
                    <li>Immich (open source Google Photos pretty much)</li>
                    <li>Various sandboxes and Solaris test VMs</li>
                </ul>
