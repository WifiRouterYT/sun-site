                        <p>Hello, and welcome to my site!! <img src="gif/wave.gif" height="14px"></p>
                        <p>I'm WifiRouter, a little creature sitting in their chair at their desk (and sometimes in my basement) who enjoys retro computing, mid 2000s to early 2010s video games and accompanying game consoles (love my PS Vita & PSP to death), and web development.</p>

                <p>This website is part of my little retro corner that I've made to escape the big scary modern internet and to preserve history, as well as to breathe some new life into some old servers/workstations. As a matter of fact, this website is running on a Sun Ultra 10 workstation from 1998!</p>

                <p>Check out my FTP server full of archives and old mirrors (mostly Sun Microsystems related stuff) using the link in the nav bar, or check out what other services I run (including some forgotten and lost services!) on the "Services" page.</p>

                <p>If you have suggestions, questions, complaints, want to donate hardware, or want to upload more forgotten software onto my FTP server, feel free to contact me on the "Contact" panel.</p>
